**Euclid's algorithm (GCD).**

The GCD (Greatest Common divisor) of two numbers is the largest number by which both are divisible.
E.g.; gcd(42, 18) is 6, since 6 is the highest common factor (HCFâ€”same thing as GCD) of 42 and 18.

Task:\n
Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and computes their GCD using Euclid's algorithm.
The process is described below:
* First, compute the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller one.
* Next, replace the larger number with the smaller number, and the smaller number with the remainder.
* Repeat this process until the smaller number equals zero. The GCD is the last value of the larger number.
