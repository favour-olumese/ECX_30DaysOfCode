"""
**USSD Bank Service**

Task: \n
- User provides a USSD code as input
- User can then choose among a list of options (with number), whether to balance, send money, purchase airtime, etc.
- For check balance, the user is prompted to provide his password (hard-coded by you).
If correct, he is shown the balance (also hard coded)
- For sending money, the user is prompted to choose from a selection of banks,
after which he provides an account number, and then an amount to send; and then a password,
which if correct, would send the required amount, and deduct from account balance.
- Follow a similar scheme as sending money, for purchasing airtimeâ€”except that in this case,
the user is ported for a phone number instead.
