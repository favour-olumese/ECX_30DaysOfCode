"""
**USSD Bank Service**

Task: \n

Create a mock USSD service that takes users' input and provides appropriate responses.
* Users provide a USSD code as input

* Users can then choose among a list of options (with numbers), whether to check their balance,
send money, purchase airtime, etc.

* To check their balance, users are prompted to provide their password (hard-coded by you).
If correct, they are shown the balance—also hard-coded.

* For sending money, users are prompted to choose from a selection of banks,
after which they are to provide an account number, and then an amount to send. And then a password,
which if correct, would send the required amount and deduct it from their account balance.

* Follow a similar scheme as sending money, for purchasing airtime—except that in this case,
users are prompted for a phone number instead.
